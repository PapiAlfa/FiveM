Setting up a FiveM server in 2020
A step-by-step guide on setting up FXServer in 2020
Running an FXServer
FXServer is the name of the current CitizenFX server version. This page shows you how to run it.
Having trouble running your server? Visit server issues, use the Discord #fxserver-support channel or create a topic in the Server Discussion sub-category on the forum.
Windows server
Prerequisites
1. Visual C++ Redistributable 2019 or newer.
2. Git to assure a correct installation.
Installation
1. Create a new directory (for example D:\FXServer\server), this will be used for the server binaries.
2. Download the latest master branch build for Windows from the artifacts server.
3. Extract the build into the directory previously created.
3b. Use any archiving tool (such as WinRAR or 7-Zip).
4. Clone cfx-server-data in a new folder outside of your server binaries folder, for example, D:\FXServer\server-data.
4b. git clone https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data.git server-data
5. Make a server.cfg file in your server-data folder (copy the example server.cfg file below into that file).
6. Generate a license key at https://keymaster.fivem.net.
7. Set the license key in your server.cfg using sv_licenseKey "licenseKeyGoesHere".
8. Run the server from the server-data folder. For example, in a plain Windows command prompt (cmd.exe) window:
9. cd /d D:\FXServer\server-data
10. D:\FXServer\server\FXServer.exe +exec server.cfg
(the /d flag is only needed when changing directory to somewhere on a different drive)

Linux server
1. Create a new folder (for example mkdir /home/username/FXServer/server), this will be used for the server binaries.
2. Download the latest master branch build for Linux from the artifacts server(copy the URL for the latest server version and use wget <url> to download it).
3. Extract the build to the directory that was previously created, using cd /home/username/FXServer/server && tar xf fx.tar.xz (you need to have xz installed, on Debian/Ubuntu this is in the xz-utils package).
4. Clone cfx-server-data in a new folder outside of your server binaries folder.
4b. For example git clone https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data.git /home/username/FXServer/server-data
5. Make a server.cfg file in your server-data folder (copy the example server.cfg file below into that file).
6. Generate a license key at https://keymaster.fivem.net.
7. Set the license key in your server.cfg using sv_licenseKey "licenseKeyGoesHere".
8. Run the server from the server-data folder.
8b. bash /home/username/FXServer/server/run.sh +exec server.cfg
Common issues
* If you don't get any ‘resources found’, and it says ‘Failed to start resource’, you didn't ‘cd’ to the right folder.
* If no resources get started, and you can't connect, you didn't add +exec.
* If you get ‘no license key was specified’, one of the above things applies.
server.cfg
An example server.cfg follows.
# Only change the IP if you're using a server with multiple network interfaces, otherwise change the port only.
endpoint_add_tcp "0.0.0.0:30120"
endpoint_add_udp "0.0.0.0:30120"

# These resources will start by default.
ensure mapmanager
ensure chat
ensure spawnmanager
ensure sessionmanager
ensure fivem
ensure hardcap
ensure rconlog
ensure scoreboard

# This allows players to use scripthook-based plugins such as the legacy Lambda Menu.
# Set this to 1 to allow scripthook. Do note that this does _not_ guarantee players won't be able to use external plugins.
sv_scriptHookAllowed 0

# Uncomment this and set a password to enable RCON. Make sure to change the password - it should look like rcon_password "YOURPASSWORD"
#rcon_password ""

# A comma-separated list of tags for your server.
# For example:
# - sets tags "drifting, cars, racing"

# A valid locale identifier for your server's primary language.
# For example "en-US", "fr-CA", "nl-NL", "de-DE", "en-GB", "pt-BR"
sets locale "root-AQ" 
# please DO replace root-AQ on the line ABOVE with a real language! :)

# Set an optional server info and connecting banner image url.
# Size doesn't matter, any banner sized image will be fine.
#sets banner_detail "https://url.to/image.png"
#sets banner_connecting "https://url.to/image.png"

# Set your server's hostname
sv_hostname "FXServer, but unconfigured"

# Nested configs!

#load_server_icon myLogo.png

# convars which can be used in scripts

# Uncomment this line if you do not want your server to be listed in the server browser.
# Do not edit it if you *do* want your server listed.
#sv_master1 ""

# Add system admins
add_ace group.admin command allow # allow all commands
add_ace group.admin command.quit deny # but don't allow quit

# Hide player endpoints in external log output.
sv_endpointprivacy true
